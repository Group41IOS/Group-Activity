### Notes
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    -    Allows for on-the-spot note-taking which is more conveniently accessed via app than going to a website within a browser
    -    Creates a feeling of carrying around an actual notebook in your phone/back pocket that is hard to replicate with a website, where you constantly are aware that your content is connected to the Internet and isn't specific to your phone
- **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - Makes on-the-spot note-taking so much more convenient (don't need to carry around a notebook anymore; you're already going to be carrying around a phone for other reasons)
    - Users would enjoy not having to write down their thoughts with pen and paper -- people's preferences for taking notes on their laptop in class can partly be attributed to the ease of typing over writing by hand, which provides evidence that this is an existing market
- **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
    - Anyone that currently carries around a notebook, has stray thoughts all the time, etc. would benefit. Huge market, not necessarily unique.
- **Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
    - Habit-forming in the sense that users become accustomed to turning to Notes to take down their thoughts, rather than just thinking about things within their mind. Not addictive necessarily however.
- **Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
    -  Fundamentally small scope: provide an easy way to record text in a personal manner (limited to individual use rather than collaboration liek Google Docs/HackMD)
    -  Has still stayed true to that goal, but expanded to become more connected to other online/mobile applications where people may be interested in recording/sharing Notes 

### Google Calendar
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** How uniquely mobile is the product experience?
    -    Your phone is carried with you everywhere you go, so the app is better able to make sure you're sticking to your commitments in a way websites cannot (scheduled, push notifications, location tips/easy to automatically go to Google maps)
- **Story:** How compelling is the story around this app once completed?
    - Everyone has been late to a meeting before or had a hard time finding a location, the app makes both of those issues much easier to resolve/less likely to occur in the future
    - Both are also fairly severe pain points in that people strongly dislike going through either situation
    - Similar to Notes, perceived to be much easier to carry around than a physical planner
- **Market:** How large or unique is the market for this app?
    - Large market of anyone who has a lot of commitments in life and would benefit from an easier way to stay on top of those commitments
- **Habit:** How habit-forming or addictive is this app?
    - The act of turning to the app as the first place to note down new meetings etc. is definitely habit-forming for the sense of accomplishment and relief one gets afterwards
- **Scope:** How well-formed is the scope for this app?
    - Narrow scope initially of creating a personal planner, digitally
    - Now expanding into lots more partnerships with other apps (Google Maps, locations/dates in emails, etc.), and it is now easier to schedule events with other Calendar users. These partnerships increase the number of ways Calendar can achieve its original mission, but that original mission itself does not seem to have changed much (scope is still well-defined).

        - V2 could allow users to maintain multiple budgets (and then have a setting to track how the user is doing overall across certain sub-budgets in aggregate). V2 could also allow groups (multiple users) to access the same budget (useful for student groups -- could then connect it to a desktop version or automatically generate Excel speradsheets documenting the expenditures so far; this could help with generating reports to administrators). 
        - V3 could give users reminders of the current state of their budget when the app detects that they're stepping into a store (this requires access to the user's geographic location). 
        - V4 could incorporate partnerships with banks and Venmo to make student budgeting even more intuitive/automatic. Also, perhaps V4 could also include partnerships with popular shops among the main user demographics to create reward users as they reach their goals.
